						CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young <br>
						physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s <br>
						appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and <br>
						equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics. <br>
						<br>
						He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic <br>
						particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he <br>
						discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. <br>
						A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could <br>
						have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a <br>
						repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed <br>
						of light for a prodigiously violent instant. <br>
						<br>
						If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the <br>
						heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, <br>
						warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the <br>
						wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, <br>
						but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. <br>
						<br>
						“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of <br>
						the page and drew a double box around it. <br>
						<br>
						On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers <br>
						reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and <br>
						that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked <br>
						right. <br>

						<br>
						Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic <br>
						time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led <br>
						by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for <br>
						Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so <br>
						-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being <br>
						wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a <br>
						trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought <br> 
						smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his <br>
						colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. <br>
						<br>
						Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though <br>
						many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be <br>
						proved. <br>
						<br>
						If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in <br>
						science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing <br>
						the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast <br>
						realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation. <br>
						<br>
						Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, <br>
						extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of <br> 
						billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos <br> 
						whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, <br>
						beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of <br>
						other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta <br>
						water boiling over. <br>
						<br>
						<h4>‘As Big as It Gets’</h4>
						<br>
						In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces <br>
						operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle <br>
						accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. <br>
						Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of <br>
						gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of <br>
						general relativity, should ruffle space-time. <br>
						<br>
						Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early- <br>
						universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, <br>
						as big as it gets.” <br>
						<br>
						He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, <br> 
						sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.” <br>
						<br>
						The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath <br>
						of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a <br>
						picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as <br>
						hot as the surface of the sun. <br>
						<br>
						Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known <br>
						as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic <br>
						Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the <br>
						Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers <br>
						submitted to The Astrophysical Journal. <br>

					Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only<br> 
					one in 10 million. <br>
					<br>
					Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had<br>
					not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime. <br>
					<br>
					“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have<br> 
					been lucky.” <br>
					<br>
					The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’<br>
                    worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a<br>
					leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select<br> 
					few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at<br> 
					Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who<br> 
					was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.<br>
					<br>
					“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as<br> 
                    scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he<br> 
                    tended his radio telescopes. <br>
					<br>
					Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the<br> 
					most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in<br> 
					1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when<br> 
					Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s<br> 
					team, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlfIVEy_YOA&ab_channel=Stanford">
					knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him<br> 
					the news. <br>

					<br>
					Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered <br>
					anything. <br>
					<br>
					“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was <br>
					a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I <br>
					simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde <br>
					wrote in an email. <br>
					<br>
					Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he <br>
					was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of <br>
					spoiling a vacation,” he said. <br>
					<br>
					By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that <br>
					inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists <br>
					responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.	<br>
					<br>
					Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think <br>
					that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest <br>
					discoveries in the history of science.”	<br>
					<br>
					John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor <br>
					and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, <br>
					pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are <br>
					beautiful and very convincing,” he said. <br>
					<br>
					Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation <br>
					that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, <br>
					said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he <br>
					expressed reservations about inflation.	<br>
					<br>
					Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized <br>
					the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded <br>
					earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic <br>
					background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and <br>
					other assumptions about the universe. <br>
					<br>
					“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. <br>
					Krauss said. <br>
					<br>
					Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft <br>
					will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams <br>
					are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and <br>
					space.	<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Spirals in the Sky</h4>
					<br>
					Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the <br>
					cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno <br>
					Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the <br>
					Nobel Prize. <br>
					<br>
					Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these <br>
					waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a <br>
					series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, <br>
					where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The <br>
					others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie <br>
					Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of <br>
					Stanford. <br>
					<br>
					“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on <br>
					the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, <br>
					wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.	<br>
					<br>
					<div class="image">
						<img src="./images/section-4/section-4.jpeg" alt=""><br>
						The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity <br>
						patterns — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart at its birth. <br>

					</div>
					<br>
					In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave <br>
					radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight <br>
					preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.	<br>
					<br>
					This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the <br>
					gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in <br>
					one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist <br>
					the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a <br>
					result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows <br>
					going in spirals. <br>
					<br>
					Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small <br>
					differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s <br>
					telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting <br>
					thermometer. <br>
					<br>
					“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said. <br>
					<br>
					The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they <br>
					spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making <br>
					sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might <br>
					beat them to the breakthrough.	<br>
					<br>
					<h4>A Special Time</h4>
					<br>
					The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like <br>
					Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, <br>
					suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the <br>
					universe. <br>
					<br>
					Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: <br>
					gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. <br>
					But they have long suspected that those are simply different <br>
					manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its <br>
					earliest, hottest moments. <br>
					<br>
					As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall <br>
					from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling <br>
					out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force <br>
					after another splitting away. <br>
					<br>
					That was where Dr. Guth came in. <br>
					<br>
					Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the <br>
					temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which <br>
					point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat. <br>
					<br>
					Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state <br>
					too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a <br>
					mysterious latent energy. <br>
					<br>
					Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a <br>
					kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it <br>
					was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was <br>
					created, the harder it pushed apart. <br>
					<br>
					What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size <br>
					at least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of <br>
					primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a <br>
					cosmic eye-blink. <br>
					<br>
					Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary <br>
					particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still <br>
					ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and <br>
					stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no <br>
					such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe <br>
					might be the ultimate free lunch.” <br>
					<br>
					Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting <br>
					from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, <br>
					is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable <br>
					homey expansion, t he rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, <br>
					spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the <br>
					multiverse. <br>
					<br>
					So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not <br>
					bother asking about going any deeper into the past. <br>
					<br>
					We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very <br>
					beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. <br>
					All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept <br>
					away, forever out of our view. <br>
					<br>
					“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard- <br>
					Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind <br>
					up at inflation.” <br>
